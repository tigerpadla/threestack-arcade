![ThreeStack Hero Banner](assets/images/three-stack-hero.png)

**ThreeStack Arcade** is an arcade hub and your portal back to the ‚Äô80s built for a Code Institute Full‚ÄëStack Bootcamp hackathon. The hub launches three mini-games (Action Stations, Duck 'Em Up, and Snake). This project demonstrates responsive front‚Äëend design, accessible UX, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript focused on DOM manipulation, game loops, state management, and graceful error handling. üïπÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating proficiency in front‚Äëend web development technologies. The goal was to build a polished, accessible, and fully responsive single‚Äëpage arcade hub that launches three mini‚Äëgames ‚Äî each showcasing semantic HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript focused on DOM manipulation, game loops, state management, and graceful error handling. üéÆ

The hub provides clear game previews, keyboard and touch‚Äëfriendly controls, persistent high score for Snake (localStorage), and a consistent visual design to guide users from discovery to gameplay. Game assets and code are organized into separate folders for maintainability and easy validation.

## User Experience (UX)

### Target Audience

- Casual browser game players looking for short, replayable mini-games.  
- Bootcamp assessors reviewing front‚Äëend, accessibility and JS competency.  
- Developers inspecting modular, maintainable game code.

### User Stories

Must-have:
- As a visitor, I want a simple hub to preview and launch games.  
- As a player, I want responsive, non-blocking controls with visible feedback.  

Should-have:
- Persistent highscores for replay incentive.  
- Touch controls for mobile players.

Could-have:
- Leaderboards, settings, or additional levels in future releases.

Won't-have (this release):
- Server-side persistence or multiplayer networking.

### Site Owners Goals

- Present a clean, accessible single‚Äëpage hub linking to each team member‚Äôs game.  
- Demonstrate modular CSS/JS and best practices (semantic markup, responsive layout).  
- Provide clear documentation, validation, and an easy deployment workflow.

## Features

### Existing Features (MVP)

- Arcade Hub: responsive entry page with game previews and accessible "INSERT THE COIN" play buttons.  
- Action Stations: grid-based battleships game, click or coordinate input, message log.  
- Duck 'Em Up: duck shooting game with multiple levels, rounds, score and overlays.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+) 
- Git & GitHub  
- Visual Studio Code  
- ESLint, W3C & Jigsaw validators

---

## Testing & Validation

* Responsiveness across devices  
* Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)   
* HTML & CSS validation  
* Accessibility checks

---

## Deployment

The website is live at: [ThreeStack Arcade](https://tigerpadla.github.io/threestack-arcade/)

## AI‚ÄëAssisted Development

AI tools were used to:
- Draft documentation and README content.  
- Suggest refactors for repetitive DOM updates and event handling.
- Code generation.  
- Assist with debugging game loop and collision logic.

AI accelerated iterations and documentation but final design, validation and deployment decisions were made by the team.
