## Project Overview

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating proficiency in front‚Äëend web development technologies. The goal was to build a polished, accessible, and fully responsive single‚Äëpage arcade hub that launches three mini‚Äëgames each showcasing semantic HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript focused on DOM manipulation, game loops, state management, and graceful error handling.

The hub provides clear game previews, touch‚Äëfriendly controls and a consistent visual design to guide users from discovery to gameplay.

## Mini-Games Overview

### Duck Em Up

Duck 'Em Up is a fast-paced Duck Hunt‚Äìstyle browser shooter built with semantic HTML for overlays and HUD, modular CSS for visual styling and animations, and vanilla JavaScript for game logic and audio. Players click or tap ducks to shoot them, conserve bullets, and avoid misses - rounds are grouped into levels with progressive difficulty and simple physics for falling ducks.

![Duck 'Em Up Preview](assets/images/duck-em-up-preview.png)

Key implementation details:

-   HTML

    -   Structured overlays for level and end-state UI: `#level-announcement`, `#game-over-announcement`, `#game-complete-announcement` (accessible via `aria-live` and `role` attributes).
    -   Scoreboard and bullets UI placed in a fixed header-like element for consistent visibility (`#score`, `#bullets`, `#misses`).
    -   Duck elements are appended dynamically to the document body so clicks/touches are handled naturally; restart/play controls are available in overlays.

-   JavaScript

    -   Modular functions: `addDucks()`, `moveDucks()`, `updateUI()`, `renderBullets()`, `endRound()`, `gameOver()`, `gameComplete()`, `startRound()`.
    -   Duck state machine: `flying`, `shot`, `falling`, `flyingAway` with different behaviours (velocity, falling physics, audio).
    -   Level/round progression: controlled by `levelSettings`, `roundsPerLevel` and `currentLevel`/`currentRound`.
    -   Sound design: shot, quack, fall, land, dog reactions and popup SFX play with graceful error handling for autoplay restrictions.
    -   Input handling: click/tap to shoot; document-level miss handling consumes bullets;

-   CSS

    -   Fixed scoreboard and bullet icons using responsive CSS variables.
    -   Overlays use entrance animations and the `.hidden` helper class to toggle visibility (JS adds/removes `.hidden`).
    -   Utility classes: `.dog-popup`, `.duck-shot-image`, `.heart-icon` for popups, shot/fall visuals and lives.

-   Assets

    -   Image and audio assets are stored under `assets/images/` and `assets/sounds/`.

-   UX & Accessibility

    -   `aria-live` is used for announcements so screen readers report level/game state changes.
    -   Touch and mouse support: clicks on non-duck areas count as misses (consumes bullets) to mirror classic gameplay.

-   Behaviour notes
    -   Bullets are initialized each round as `bullets = duckCount + 1`; running out of bullets causes remaining `flying` ducks to flee (`flyingAway`) and counts as misses.
    -   Shot ducks briefly show a `duck-shot` image then transition to `duck-fall` and fall with gravity.
    -   Rounds and levels progress automatically; game over and completion overlays allow the player to restart.

### Action Stations

Action Stations is a simplified clone of the classic game Battleship, depicting only one side of such a game. It was implemented as a single-page app and designed in such a way as to create the feeling of being in a cold-war era surface warship heading into combat, minimising the use of graphics and utilising a special pixel font to approximate the look of low-power computer systems of the era. Special attention was played to placing ‚Äúenvironmental storytelling‚Äù elements on the game screen to allow the player to take a deeper dive into the game world without having this forced on them.

![assets/images/actionStations_gamePlay.png]

- Key Implementation Details
  - HTML
    - Three-column structure for game board, message log and environmental lore
    - 8x8 game board built using html table
    - Manual target input field and dedicated ‚ÄúFire‚Äù button
    - Dedicated buttons trigger modal pop-ups that provide background lore as well as an explanation of symbols used in gameplay
    - Inactive buttons included for environmental storytelling

  - JavaScript
    - Main functions: constructor(), generateShips(), generateShipLocations(), fire(), guess(), processGuess(), displayHit(), displayMiss(), displayMessage()
    - Math.random() & Math.floor() used to randomise ship position & orientation
    - Gameplay loop: Clicking on game board or entering coordinates and pressing ‚ÄúFire‚Äù button triggers game to check targeted cell ID against known cell ID of target ship. A hit triggers   displayHit() function which displays the appropriate icon on the map, while a miss triggers displayMiss(), which display the icon for a missed shot. Both functions in turn trigger   displayMessage(), which gives text feedback that is shown to player in Message Log.
    - Input: Mouse-based. Provision for keyboard input exists but requires further work

  - CSS
    - Bootstrap used for general layout
    - Custom styling used to recreate 1980s-era computer appearance
    - Bootstrap modals and buttons fitted with additional custom classes to ensure consistent appearance

  - Design Statement
    - Design deliberately minimalist to mimic a work station on a cold-war era warship
    - Specific inspiration was drawn from Royal Navy Type 42 destroyers such as HMS Sheffield or HMS Liverpool, the player ship in Action Stations.
    - Icons used to show hits and misses are drawn from NTDS (Navy Tactical Data System) symbology still used by navies of all NATO members as outlined in NATO STANAG 4420.
    - Use of inactive buttons to indicate inoperable systems, as well as flavour text in Modals are used to create a WW3 ambience and provide in-universe justification for simply shooting at grid squares.
    
-   Behaviour notes
    -   Bullets are initialized each round as `bullets = duckCount + 1`; running out of bullets causes remaining `flying` ducks to flee (`flyingAway`) and counts as misses.
    -   Shot ducks briefly show a `duck-shot` image then transition to `duck-fall` and fall with gravity.
    -   Rounds and levels progress automatically; game over and completion overlays allow the player to restart.

### Snake

Snake is a classic browser game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, rendered on a 32√ó32 grid. Players control the snake with arrow keys (or on-screen buttons) to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with walls or itself. The game demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, grid-based movement logic, modular architecture, and responsive design.

![Snake Preview](assets/images/snake-thumbnail.png)

Key implementation details:

-   HTML

    -   Semantic structure with container for grid and UI (scoreboard, game messages).
    -   ARIA labels for accessibility and focusable controls.
    -   Modular sections separated for readability and maintainability.

-   JavaScript

    -   Grid system: 32√ó32 layout represented as arrays of `{ x, y }` coordinates.
    -   Snake logic: movement updates the array, collision detection, growth when eating food.
    -   Game loop: updates position, renders snake segments, detects collisions.
    -   Event handling: arrow keys and optional on-screen buttons.
    -   LocalStorage used for high score persistence.
    -   Functions modularized: `moveSnake()`, `generateFood()`, `detectCollision()`, `updateScore()`, `resetGame()`, etc.

-   CSS

    -   CSS Grid for the board (`grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows`).
    -   Pixel-art ready styling for snake, food, and background.
    -   Directional classes for snake head, body, and tail for proper rotation.
    -   Responsive design and visual feedback for collisions and food consumption.

-   Assets

    -   Optional pixel art sprites for snake segments and food.
    -   Background images or color schemes stored in `assets/images/`.

-   Accessibility & UX

    -   Keyboard-friendly controls with visual focus indicators.
    -   High contrast pixel graphics for visibility.
    -   Scoreboard is clearly displayed with real-time updates.

-   Behaviour notes
    -   Snake moves continuously on a grid; player changes direction with keys.
    -   Eating food grows the snake and increments the score.
    -   Collision with wall or self ends the game and shows reset option.
    -   Game reset restores grid and snake to initial state.
